The game should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## How to Play
To play the game, click the "Start" button to begin. Locate the number "1" on the grid and click on it. Find the next number in ascending order, and click on it. Keep clicking on numbers in ascending order until you reach the last number on the grid. Once you click on the last number, the timer will stop and your game time will be displayed.

If you need to take a break or pause the game, click on the "Stop" button. You can resume the game by clicking on any number again. If you want to start a new game, click on the "Restart" button.
